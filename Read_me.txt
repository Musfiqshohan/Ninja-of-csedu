The game "Ninja of Csedu" is
designed and coded by 
Md.musfiqur Rahman and Fairuz Nawer Meem
Department of Computer Science and Engineering
.
The game is made as a project of our 2nd semester in 1st year of Csedu.
.
The game is basically designed compared to the problems and challenges we face during 
studying computer science. 

Like the ninja we will overcome all the obstacles and reach at our destination.
And we are the ninja of Csedu.
The intention of this game is to inspire the CSE students.

In the first level we used (enemy figures) :
1. C
2. C++
3. Multimeter
4. Jombie ( as fraustration we face in 1st year)

In the second level we use ( enemy figures):
1. Java
2. Transistors
3. Teleportation
4. Mummy ( as the reflection of ACM ICPC to encourage the students)




We are just beginners. So, you may find many bugs in our game. We are really sorry for that.
Enjoy !!! :)
